# CRUD APPLICATION SQL/NODE/EJS  JAVASCRIPT frontend using fetch to all endpoints except GET as explained below

## Employee Database Where user can GET, POST, UPDATE and DELETE employees.

### When using the update(PUT), user searches by name, then if user exists it will display infromation with an edit button when clicked. Inputs will pop up with placeholders with the previous information. You can then either keep or edit the fields as the user sees fit.

### For all employees I render  example = (res.status(200).render(employees)) then I use a ejs syntax to loop through them.

### When user either creates or updates, the page will reload so new information will be displayed and the delete button will delete information and reload also.
